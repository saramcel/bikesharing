# Bike Sharing Field Research

## Overview

### Background
We are helping our friend Kate to research the bikeshare business in New York City so that we can make a proposal to start a bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. The data we selected was from August of 2019, because we wanted to analyze peak use during the summer. There is a potential angel investor who wants to help with the seed funding for the business in Des Moines, so we will create a business proposal with a Tableau Story. 

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We are sharing a bike trip analysis to convince one of the key stakeholders. We are interested in what kind of users are riding (e.g. males and females, subscribers or customers), and the characteristics of the trips they are taking (e.g. time of trip, length of trip, locations of start and end points). 

## Results

The results can be viewed using the link below. There are screenshots of each data visualization below, and summaries of the conclusions from each image.

** Checkout Times for Users **
![checkout times for users]()
- This graph shows that most rides are less than 23 minutes long, and the vast proportion of rides are less than an hour. The trip length that most users seem to take is about 5 minutes. 

** Checkout Times by Gender **
![checkout times by gender]()
- This graph shows that most bike riders are male, and that the trends for male and female riders are similar. Both male and female rides tend to spike at 5-6 minutes per trip, and trips tend to taper off around 47 minutes for all reported genders. Unknown gender has a flat curve, with low kurtosis. 

** Trips by Weekday per Hour **
![trips by weekday per hour]()
- This heatmap shows that the most common stoptimes are right before typical work hours on each weekday, and right after work hours on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. Wednesday evenings are not as popular for Citibike, for reasons that we should investigate--possibly there is a competing form of transportation, for example a free bus that runs on Wednesday evenings. On the weekends, the bikes are used throughout daylight hours, mostly in the mornings and more often on Saturdays than Sundays. 

** Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) **
![trips by gender weekday per hour]()
- Males, who compose most of the ridership, have a defined pattern of riding that is much like what we observed in the previous graph. The heatmap for females shows a similar pattern,but with less ridership. The unknown gender seems to use the bikes on Saturday afternoon more than any other time.

** User Trips by Gender by Weekday **
![user trips by gender by weekday]()
- This heatmap shows customers vs subscribers and each recorded gender. Customers take fewer trips than subscribers, as one might expect. The heaviest use is by males who are subscribers. The highest usage day for males and females is Thursday. The unknown gender most often uses on the weekends as a customer--these might be tourists.

## Summary

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
